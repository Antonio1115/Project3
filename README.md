Project#3 for CS5393-002

My objective is to practice using Git and GitHub by developing a sentiment analysis tool that assesses whether a tweet's sentiment is positive or negative. In order to do this, I defined a custom string type called DSString and implemented a DSString class, which ensured proper memory allocation and management according to the rule of three.

The sentiment analysis process is made up of two main phases: training and testing. During the training phase, the sentiment value of a word is calculated based on its frequency in positive or negative tweets. In the testing phase, I compared the generated list of positive and negative words from the training phase with a reference dataset that includes the correct sentiment classifications. Lastly, I determined the accuracy of the sentiment analysis by dividing the number of correctly classified tweets by the total number of tweets in the test dataset.
